# Sample

In order to improve the quality of our screenshots, we created this folder with standardized code snippets.

## Instructions

After you're done taking a screenshot, feel free to delete this `sample` folder.

## Why this is cool?

* It contains examples of string, number, and array
* It contains examples of single line and multi-line comments
* It contains examples of inheritance and functions
* It's simple, funny, and silly :)

## Is there a programming language missing?

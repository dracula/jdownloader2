### [JDownloader2](https://jdownloader.org/)

#### Install using Git

If you are a Git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/dracula/jdownloader2.git

#### Install manually

Download using the [GitHub .zip download](https://github.com/dracula/jdownloader2/archive/master.zip) option and unzip them.

#### Activating theme

1. In JDownloader2, go to Settings > Advanced Settings
2. Search for `GraphicalUserInterfaceSettings: Look And Feel Theme` and change the value from Default to `FLATLAF_DRACULA`
3. Get the `FlatDarculaLaf.json` file and place it in the JDownloader installation directory. By default this is `C:\Program Files\JDownloader\cfg\laf` but the JDownloader root directory where it was installed is what you want to look for (you can create the cfg and laf folders if they don't exist).
4. Restart JDownloader2
